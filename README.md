Reporting library, using Razor templates to generate HTML, Excel and PDF reports


## Is this legit??
It is in use in two production systems that I know of. One is a mature portfolio 
management product that has reports generated both on a desktop client and an ASP.NET client. The big
benefit is you have a single report specification, using domain objects, written in Razor, and surfaced in
multiple environments in different formats. It's not drag and drop pretty and you may have to use tables for layouts
but you get solid, reliable results.

Note that IKVM cannot currently be upgraded to the current version (8.x) as the Apache FOP 1.1 DLL generated by IKVM fails when running against the new IKVM version. Possibly rebuilding the FOP DLL would help, but there isn't a huge benefit to be gained from this (unless you require a later version of IKVM for another dependency). Issue #23 relates to this.

## Installation

Although the example library and documentation uses Razor as the template engine, the report library itself will accept input from any source, including static XML. To use Razor, install the [Razor Generator](http://razorgenerator.codeplex.com/) VS extension first.

Install the engine via [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/crispin), either in Visual Studio (right-click project, Manage NuGet Packages, search for `crispin`) or via the package manager console using `Install-Package crispin`.

There is also a [Razor example package](http://nuget.org/packages/crispin.razor) which includes `swxben.crispin` and some examples to get started. A [crispin.System.Web package](http://nuget.org/packages/crispin.System.Web) is used to replace basic Razor features found via `System.Web` such as automatic HTML encoding and `Html.Raw()` that aren't found in Razor Generator's template library without having to depend on `System.Web`.


## Usage

Either create a new library project or use an existing project. The report templates will be generated into .cs files via Razor. Install the [RazorGenerator.Templating](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RazorGenerator.Templating) package. Add a report template to the project as a text file with an extension of `.cshtml`. In the file's properties, change `Custom Tool` to `RazorGenerator`. A barebones report template has this format:

	@* Generator: Template *@<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
	<!DOCTYPE report [
	]>
	<report>
		<title>...</title>
		<content>
			<pageSequence orientation="portrait">
				<htmlBlock>
					<h1>Report</h1>
				</htmlBlock>
			</pageSequence>
		</content>
	</report>

The XML is a bit verbose because the converter uses the same XML to generate the output in several methods including XSL-FO to produce PDFs which needs data about the layout of the resulting document.

This markup is then parsed by one of the report converters (`CsvReportConverter`, `HtmlReportConverter` and `PdfReportConverter), using XSLT to transform the report into the output format.

The `PdfReportConverter` transforms the report markup into XSL-FO, which is then processed by Apache FOP (a Java library, converted to .NET using IKVM) into PDF in memory.


### Reporting service

The `ReportingService` class contains helpers for transforming and managing reports. It implements `IReportingService` for DI goodyness:

    IReportingService reportingService = new ReportingService();

    // or, with Autofac:

    builder.RegisterType<ReportingService>().As<IReportingService>();


#### OpenAsPdf

Converts the report markup to a PDF and saves it to a temporary file, then opens it using `Process.Start`.

    reportingService.OpenAsPdf(report.TransformText(), "Name of report");

#### ConvertToPdf

Converts the report markup to a PDF and returns a byte array containing the PDF.

	var buf = reportingService.ConvertToPdf(report.TransformText(), "Name of report");

#### ConvertToCsv

Converts the report markup to a CSV (comma separated value) formatted string, by exporting any `table` elements with a `type` attribute equal to `DataGrid` or `Data` (`<table type="DataGrid">`).

	var csv = reportingService.ConvertToCsv(report.TransformText());

#### ConvertToHtml

Converts the report markup to HTML.

	var html = reportingService.ConvertToCsv(report.TransformText());


### crispin.System.Web

Minimal workarounds to support `System.Web` assumptions built in to Razor features such as `Html.Raw()`, automatic HTML encoding (eg `@("<em>&</em>")), helpers and `IHtmlString`. Make the template inherit from `System.Web.Razor.CustomRazorTemplateBase` to get the features to work properly.

	@* Generator: Template *@<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
	@inherits System.Web.Razor.CustomRazorTemplateBase
	...
	@helper Embolden(string s) {
		<strong>@s</strong>
	}
	@{
		var subtemplate = new Subtemplate();
	}
	...
	<p>Escape plain at values: @("<em>not emphasised</em>")</p> 
	<p>Html.Raw(): @Html.Raw("<em>emphasised</em>")</p>
	<p>Embolden helper: @Embolden("emboldened")</p>
	<p>@Html.Raw(subtemplate.TransformText())</p>

#### System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper

A protected instance of `System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper` is exposed in `System.Web.Razor.CustomRazorTemplateBase` as `Html`. The only method implemented is `Raw()` which just returns the input as a `IHtmlString` to avoid automatic HTML encoding.

#### System.Web.WebPages.HelperResult

This is used in the class generated from the Razor template to implement helpers.

#### System.Web.IHtmlString

See <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ihtmlstring.aspx>.


## Release notes

### 2.3.0

- Update FOP to 2.0! woohoo!
- Support for SVGs in both HTML and PDF
- Support the `a` tag in PDFs

### 2.2.2

- Trim whitespace from incoming XRPT data, to help sanitise reports generated from Razor where the `<?xml` tag may not be the very first thing

### 2.2.1

- Revert the IKVM and RazorGenerator upgrade, as it was breaking in production...

### 2.2

- Upgraded IKVM and RazorGenerator
- Added new methods to `ReportingService` for converting report markup to PDF byte buffers, CSV and HTML

### 2.1

- Added support for setting the `external-graphic` scaling attribute (via `<img scaling="[uniform|non-uniform|inherit]">`). See <http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/#scaling>.
- Remove workaround for non-JPEGS
	- Originally non-JPEG images were transparently converted to JPEGS and written back to the XSL using a `file://` url. This was to compensate for a version of Apache FOP being used that didn't support images that weren't JPEG. The version of Apache FOP in use supports PNGs so I'm dropping the hack.

## Building, running tests and the NuGet package

THe VS2010 solution is in the root folder. Unit tests (coming up) can be run in a console using `tests.bat`. The NuGet package can be built by running `build-nuget-package.cmd`.

### Upgrading FOP, Batik and IKVM

[Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) is used to convert XSL-FO into a PDF but it is written in Java, so [IKVM](http://www.ikvm.net) is used to convert FOP into a .NET assembly and to provide a Java runtime to FOP.

The IKVM dependency is managed via NuGet but the FOP assembly is created and upgraded manually. To upgrade FOP (including to support new versions of IKVM):

1. Download the latest or target version of IKVM from <http://www.ikvm.net> (you need a BIN release)
2. Download the latest binary release of Apache FOP from <http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>
3. Decompress both packages to the desktop
4. Open a console and cd to `%DESKTOP%\fop-x.xx\lib\`
5. Run: `..\..\<path to ikvm>\bin\ikvmc -out:fop-x.xx.dll *.jar ..\build\fop.jar`

A number of warnings and errors will come up, hopefully they can be ignored and the new `fop-x.xx.dll` file will be created in the current folder. Copy the DLL to the `swxben.reporting/lib` folder and update the FOP reference to the new assembly. Note that the IKVM version used to create the FOP assembly needs to match the IKVM version used by `swxben.reporting`.
